You are tasked with determining whether a given set of random variables is sufficient to generate a representative dataset for a specific case. You will be provided with a dataset description and a list of random variables. Your goal is to analyze these inputs and determine if the random variables are adequate for creating the dataset.
First, carefully examine the dataset:
<sample_dataset>
{{csv}}
</sample_dataset>
Now, examine the list of random variables:
<random_variables>
{{random_vars}}
</random_variables>
Analyze the dataset requirements and the provided random variables. Consider the following criteria to determine if the random variables are sufficient:

Do the random variables cover all essential aspects of the data in $SAMPLE_DATASET
Are there enough variables to create diverse and realistic data points?
Do the variables allow for the necessary variations in data characteristics as described in the dataset description?
Are there any crucial elements of the dataset that are not represented by the random variables?
Are random variables values coherent and related to the description?

Based on your analysis, determine whether the random variables are sufficient for generating the dataset.
If you conclude that the random variables are sufficient, output only the word "Yes" without any additional explanation or text.
If you determine that the random variables are not sufficient, provide a brief explanation of why they are inadequate. Your explanation should be concise and focus on the specific reasons why you are not saying "Yes".
Your response should be in one of these two formats:

Yes
[Reason why the random variables are not sufficient]

Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting in your response.
