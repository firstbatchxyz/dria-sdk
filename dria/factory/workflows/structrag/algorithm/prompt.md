Instruction:
Based on the requirements described in the Requirement section, extract the necessary algorithm pseudocode from the Raw Content.
You are required to follow the reasoning and output format provided in the Examples, ensuring that each action in the pseudocode is linked to specific information from the original document.
Note: If the requirements described cannot be resolved using pseudocode, do not force it. Instead, simply list the information that can address the requirements.
Examples:
########
Initialize components:
Intel_CPU = "Intel high performance multi-core CPU"
Huawei_CPU = "Huawei AI-powered multitasking CPU with thermal management"
Apple_CPU = "Apple efficient CPU with seamless macOS integration"
Huawei_Monitor = - Fan_120mm = "120mm standard cooling fan"
Fan_140mm = "140mm high-efficiency fan"
Evaluate user requirements:
if need high-performance CPU:
IF user needs high refresh rate display:
selected_CPU = Intel_CPU # According to original content, Intel CPU is high performance
