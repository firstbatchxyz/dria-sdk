Given these solutions:
<solutions>
{{solutions}}
</solutions>

For this query:
<query>
{{query}}
</query>

For these document info:
<documents_info>
{{documents_info}}
</documents_info>

Compare the solutions and provide a final ranking using '>', '<', and '=' symbols.
Example final ranking:
<final_ranking> Algorithm > Table = Graph > Catalog > Chunk </final_ranking>


Format your response as:
<comparison_analysis>
[Brief comparison of solutions]
</comparison_analysis>
