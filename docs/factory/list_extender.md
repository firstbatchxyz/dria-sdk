# ListExtender

`ListExtenderPipeline` is a class that creates a pipeline for extending a given list of items. The pipeline generates new items based on the existing ones.

## Class Overview

The `ListExtenderPipeline` class has the following components:

- Constructor: Initializes the pipeline with a `Dria` instance and a `PipelineConfig`.
- `build` method: Constructs the pipeline based on the given list. 
  - `granularize`: If set to True, the pipeline will generate detailed subtopics, extending the list with more granular topics.

```python
import asyncio
import os

from dria.client import Dria
from dria.factory import ListExtenderPipeline
from dria.pipelines import PipelineConfig
import json

dria = Dria(rpc_token=os.environ["DRIA_RPC_TOKEN"])


async def evaluate():
    await dria.initialize()
    pipeline = ListExtenderPipeline(dria, PipelineConfig()).build(list=["Wildlife", "Computers", "Food", "Physics", "Communication", "Music", "Sociology", "Art", "Modern Art", "Mechanical Physics"], granularize=True)
    res = await pipeline.execute(return_output=True)
    print("Done")
    with open("lists.json", "w") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(res, indent=2))
    print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(evaluate())
```

Expected output:
